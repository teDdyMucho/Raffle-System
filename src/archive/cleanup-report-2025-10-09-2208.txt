Cleanup Report (2025-10-09 22:08)
Project: mamamoraffle/src

Summary
- This report lists likely-unused components and assets based on static route/import analysis.
- No files were deleted or moved. This is an advisory list for review.
- Criteria: files that export a default but are not referenced from the routed entry points (App.js) or indirectly through used layout/components.

Entry Points and Key Routes (from src/App.js)
- Public: /login -> components/Auth/Login.js
- Public: /signup -> components/Auth/SignUp.js
- Public helper: /copy-ref -> components/Shared/CopyReferral.js
- User routes (protected):
  - /user -> components/User/UserLanding.js
  - /user/join -> components/User/JoinRaffles.js
  - /user/results -> components/User/PastResults.js
  - /user/profile -> components/User/UserProfile.js
- Agent routes (protected):
  - /agent -> components/Agent/AgentLayout.js (internal navigation loads Agent sub-pages)
- Global UI/Context: contexts/ThemeContext.js, contexts/ToastContext.js, contexts/AuthContext.js, contexts/NotificationContext.js, components/UI/ToastContainer.js, components/PopupAds.js

Likely Unused Components (candidates)
- components/Layout/AdminLayout.js
  - Not imported or routed in App.js.
  - No other entry references detected.
- components/Admin/* (entire directory)
  - Files: AdminDashboard.js, AdminOverview.js, RaffleManagement.js, Reports.js, UserManagement.js
  - None of these are imported by App.js directly.
  - Not referenced by Agent or User layouts. Appears to be a future/admin area not yet wired.

Notes on Agent components (likely used)
- AgentLayout.js (routed at /agent) renders:
  - AgentDashboard.js, ImageManager.js, AgentProfile.js, AgentSettings.js, AgentCommissionTracker.js
  - These are considered in-use via internal Agent navigation.

Notes on User components (used)
- UserLanding.js, JoinRaffles.js, PastResults.js, UserProfile.js, UserLayout.js, UserHeader.js
- All appear either routed or used by those routed pages.

Images and Assets
- images/manifest.js is imported by components/Agent/ImageManager.js to support bulk import to storage.
- Known direct image imports:
  - components/User/PastResults.js -> images/winnerads.png
  - components/User/UserProfile.js -> images/cashinads.png
- Due to possible dynamic usage via storage URLs and future features, no images are marked unused in this pass.

Other Context Files
- contexts/* (AuthContext, ThemeContext, ToastContext, NotificationContext): used by App.js providers.
- lib/* (supabaseClient.js, imageUrl.js, wallet.js): referenced by various components (in use).

Recommendations
1) If you confirm the Admin section is not needed right now, archive or delete:
   - components/Layout/AdminLayout.js
   - components/Admin/AdminDashboard.js
   - components/Admin/AdminOverview.js
   - components/Admin/RaffleManagement.js
   - components/Admin/Reports.js
   - components/Admin/UserManagement.js
2) Keep images as-is unless we run a content-aware check and UI review.
3) Run a linter/unused-import pass to remove dead imports within files.

Next Steps (upon approval)
- Move the listed Admin files into src/archive/unused/ (non-destructive), or delete them outright per your preference.
- Run ESLint/TS to auto-fix unused imports.
- Optional: Add a CI check for unused files and imports to prevent drift.
